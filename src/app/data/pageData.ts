    year: "2021",
    description: `
        Kick-events have been central to the success of theTime to Shine ICT #TTOSICT project at the initial stage for the past five years to promote collaboration between parents and teachers to encourage student participation.

        This one-day event presented the proposed curriculum: Scratch programming, IoT (IoT), Urban Planning, and the Open Science Framework for classroom experimentation, and during this session, the GoGirls team pointed out what they envisioned for this project, such as;
        
            Computer-literate students
            Teamwork among learners
            Interactive learning
            Critical Thinking & business modeling skills
            Knowledge on how to come up with models for urban planning  
            Diversification of knowledge
            Flexibility in the learning environment
            Exposure to different STEM careers
            Have the relevant knowledge of the real-world application of some science concepts such as IoT, #ClassroomOnPhone, and Scratching Programming.
        
        Consequently, the GoGirls team and nine teachers from primary and secondary schools within Juba exchanged ideas and knowledge on possible Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) activities for the selected students from their respective schools.
        
        Over the years, the #TTOSICT Project became a platform for teachers from various schools to discuss challenges they faced with students, learn from each other, and collaborate on relevant #STEM projects among themselves. Hence, in three different groups, the teachers highlighted the challenges they faced when teaching sciences in schools and what they envisioned?
        
         The teachers categorically shared their challenges as:
        
            A negative perception of the use of ICTs in our communities.
            Lack of training of teachers on ICTs 
            Lack of computer Labs and ICT resources in most schools explains why even schools, up to today, type and print their exams at different computer centers.
            Language barrier, in most cases Arabic – pattern.
            The new textbook framework has outdated technology and programming languages.
            The new textbooks are very shallow and lack substantial content.
            Girls are not encouraged to take ICT as a career because some parents still look at ICT as a male profession.
        
        What they envisioned for this project included;
        
            Students should be able to use science apparatus to pass information.
            Be able to apply scientific knowledge to respond to daily needs
            Students, especially girls, should use ICT Knowledge to promote businesses and use this knowledge to advance their careers in Technology.
            Students should be able to apply Mathematics in their daily lives.
            To promote individualized learning to respond to the child’s ability and personality.
            Collaborative learning. 
            Enable economic growth by broadening the reach of technology such as high-speed internet.
            Teachers still take out exams for typing at different computer centers within Juba because they lack computers.
            Internet for schools.
            We as teachers know that computers are for boys – Girls need to be encouraged to take ICT as a career.
            The relevant authorities should be hosting experts to tell the public about the importance of ICTs.
            We still need more awareness on the different media platforms on the importance of ICTs.
            The relevant partners should train teachers on the new curriculum to adapt accordingly.
            It’s good to revise the syllabus of South Sudan for primary and secondary schools again. Most countries have developed because of integrating technology with other subjects such as economics, commerce, accounts, and agriculture, among others.
        
        From this engagement, the GoGirls team will take critical actions to engage with the relevant policymakers, continue to innovate in this field, and collaborate with communities on projects that benefit these communities, teachers, and students at large.
        
        This project is supported by UNDP South Sudan Peace and Community Cohesion (PACC) Project with funds from Sweden.

    year: "2021",
    description: `
      #ASKrIoT – a mentorship program that focuses on building the capacity of University students in Internet of Things (IoT) research and development of relevant applications that solve problems in their communities.

      Through this program the team is building their own version of the #ASKotec called #ASKrIoT
      
      #ASKotec: Access to Skills and Knowledge open tech emergency case
      
      The #ASKotec is a kit that is designed to work as a mobile training set and is equipped with the items needed to teach others how to use Open Tech and Open Source Hardware in order to innovate, educate, and repair items, thereby providing access to vital skills and knowledge. The kit is especially valuable to communities where access to tools and materials is often scarce.
      
      The Open Tech Emergency Case is housed in a rugged, dust-proof case and includes a range of high-quality tools and materials needed to teach hands-on skills in terms of repairs, development, and upcycling. The kit allows for
      
          learning about electronics, especially the use of small-scale solar energy.
          repairing, disassembling, and building mechanical and electronic devices.
          the development of skills and sharing of knowledge.
      
      Each #ASKotec contains over 50 items, including:
      
          electronics, connection hardware, solar elements
          soldering, cutting, measuring, and specialised mechanical tools
          arduinos, sensors, LEDs, related modules
          manuals and user-developed how-to guides
          a compact Linux computer with open source software
      
       The #ASKotec kit is part of the #ASKnet program. It was created through a series of hub-development workshops as a resource kit for community trainers who work in areas where there is neither reliable power nor internet connectivity, such as in many refugee camps, low-infrastructure regions, or rural areas.

      Objectives

    To build the capacity of teachers on hands on- practices by repairing their devices.
    To support teachers by repairing their devices to keep preparing learning materials for students and when schools resume to give students a platform to practice and learn ICT skills.
    To promote open documentation and create an open culture within schools and their surrounding communities.

    To give a platform for university students / graduates who will be part of these activities to practice their skills.

    To promote open collaborations among hubs such as Platform Africa and Youth Empowerment Foundation (YEF) in Uganda and Ataka Hub and Junub Open Space in South Sudan.

Description:

 The outbreak of the COVID-19, with a lot of restrictions, affected schools; schools plan for other alternative ways to deliver lessons to keep students learning at home. 

However, many schools and teachers face challenges with their devices like computers, phones and speakers having broken down, not being functional and the cost of fixing these devices are expensive thus, many can’t afford.

Electronic waste is a major problem because most of it is toxic. Simply throwing electronics away contributes to serious economic problems, both by producing that waste and because it wastes the resources that went into producing the device in the first place. That means that it increases the demand for mines, which pollute the environment, and more energy gets wasted in the manufacturing process. Repairs consume far fewer resources, which makes them much better for the environment.

The repair café activities in Juba by GoGirls ICT Initiative is to support schools that are beneficiaries of its activities and their surrounding communities with their electronic devices being fixed to promote a repair culture in Schools as means to inspire more girls in secondary schools to do STEM courses when they join University.

    year: "2021",
    description: `
    #ClassroomOnPhone is a pre-recorded learning program where learners are taught science subjects with the aim of enhancing the love and practice of science in primary and secondary school students.

When South Sudan went into a lock down in March 2020 due to the pandemic, we had a conservation with parents and teachers who were beneficiaries of our Time To Shine ICT #TTOSICT project on how they were and their children coping up with the closure of schools. And that’s when the GoGirls team embarked on a research on Virtual learning methods for Offline communities as part of its Access to Skills and Knowledge network #ASKnet Project.

During this time, we held workshops to introduce South Sudanese primary and secondary school Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) teachers to virtual learning, including their definition, examples, content development for virtual learning, challenges of virtual learning among others. Teachers explored virtual learning platforms both online and offline and mockup projects to create content for virtual learning.

The team further interacted with 25 students who were beneficiaries of #TTOSICT project in their various communities to know the challenges faced by students during the pandemic so that to build a knowledge base to help us tailor our training activities to the current situation. The interaction with them revealed that girls didn’t have time to read due to several home chores, noisy environment during the day so they can’t concentrate, lack of electricity and for those whom their schools provided with reading materials found Science subjects to be the most boring and hard subjects to study alone.

These findings were shared with the teachers who were providing these students with handouts and holiday packages to study at home. The teachers too found out that most of the assignments these students answered were not done by them hence proving not effective. This led us to explore cheap affordable technologies by our communities such using Micro SD cards and feature (button) phones since they are very affordable and accessible by everyone.

Together with GoGirls teams, the teachers from four primary and secondary schools developed STEM learning material with an integration of Arts (STEAM) in the form of podcasts loaded on micro SDs for a selected group of learners.

The students were introduced to virtual learning platforms and how to access these platforms including access to this content in form of podcasts hence, #ClassroomOnPhone.

      "GoGirls ICT Initiative Partners With Akirachix To Engage More Girls in ICT",
    year: "2021",
    description: `
    For the past five years, we have been implementing the Time To shine Information Communication Technology (#TTOSICT) mentorship program that aimed at Engaging, Educating, and Empowering youth, especially girls in primary and secondary schools to spark their interest in doing science at the secondary level and increase their chances of doing courses in the fields of  Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics with the integration of Arts  (STEAM). As a result of these efforts, the girls who were involved by then at the age of 11 years old in Primary Five have now joined secondary schools within Juba, and those in Secondary completed their South Sudan School Certificate in 2019. Most of these girls too were beneficiaries of our GoGirls Sponsorship Initiative to support them in school for one year as long as they continued to participate in this program.

    To encourage and keep these girls engaged in this program throughout, we reached out to their schools, families, and communities through the Family Visit Program that has become an integral part of all our projects and programming.
    
    One of the most common questions raised by the teachers, families, and communities of these girls is: “what is next for them after secondary school especially to parents who are economically challenged and girls who are vulnerable?.” To answer this question; GoGirls ICT Initiative has collaborated with Akirachix to put synergies together so as to support girls who have completed their South Sudan Secondary school certificates in 2019 to be part of their AkiraChix codeHive 2022 recruitment program.
    
    AkiraChix was founded in 2010 by a group of women who were passionate about changing the landscape of the technology field and creating a community that supports, connects, and inspires women in the tech space. These young women challenged the status quo by encouraging and facilitating more women to take up careers in technology-related fields. Its vision has continued to be led by Linda Kamau and Marie Githinji, who have committed to champion the diversity and inclusion of women in the technical workforce, changing the economic capabilities of young women as well as shifting societal norms. AkiraChix has come a long way from its beginnings, where it trained young women from Nairobi in a bus fitted with computers to a fully-fledged residential campus to serve young women from all over Kenya and other African Countries. Read more about AkiraChix: https://akirachix.com/
    
    codeHive is the AkiraChix signature program. It is a one-year fully subsidized residential hands-on technical training program. It provides education and economic opportunity to young women between the ages of  19 and 24  from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds who have completed high school education, and are unable to further their education due to financial constraints.  
    
    After expanding from Kenya to Rwanda and Uganda in 2021, AkiraChix will also expand to Tanzania and South Sudan in 2022. It is also seeking promising young women from refugee communities across these countries. 
    
    According to Women in Technology statistics, Women currently remain highly underrepresented in software engineering (14% of the total workforce) and computer science-related jobs (25% of the total workforce). Female software engineer hires have only increased 2% over the last 21 years.
    
    Through this collaboration, GoGirls ICT Initiative is one of the approved Test Centers that will provide the applicants with dedicated computers and internet to apply for this program and also use their networks to help Akirachix reach more young women to build careers in technology in South Sudan to transform their lives and communities. We constantly commit to breaking societal barriers limiting girls from doing careers in ICT and continue contributing to bridging the gender digital divide gap. Such opportunities and exposure are what these girls need. The fact that South Sudan Joined the African Telecommunications Union (ATU) as its 49th member state presents vast opportunities in this sector that we want more women and girls in South Sudan to be part of the decision making and implementation of technology-related projects.
